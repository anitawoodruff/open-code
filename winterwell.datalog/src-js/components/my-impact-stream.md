			<p>Your donation goes towards helping determined small-scale farmers like Gannat Bariso in Gambelto Kebele, southeastern Ethiopia. She recently joined the Oxfam-backed local women's co-operative, which enabled her to get a loan to buy better quality potato seeds. She also attended an Oxfam training course to improve her farming skills.
			</p><p>
			The result was startling. Gannat produced twice as much as previous years, which meant that she could easily feed her family and have enough left to sell to buy other essentials and to put back into her farm.
